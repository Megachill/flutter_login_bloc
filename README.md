### Check the branches
You will find 2 branches in the project that really matter

1. `global_bloc` which represents the idea of implementing a global single instance of the bloc
2. `scoped_bloc` which represents the more scalable approach to having instances of bloc in multiple locations

Please note, since Flutter is still under heavy development, the community and the developers,
have not yet decided on what the best approach to state management is, inside of flutter.
